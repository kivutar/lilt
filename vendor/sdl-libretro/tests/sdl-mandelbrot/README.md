# SDL-Mandelbrot

https://github.com/rodrigosetti/sdl-mandelbrot.git

This is an implementation of the Mandelbrot Set fractal in C, using the SDL
graphics library.

It's an efficient implementation along with a user interaction by the keyboard
allowing zooming and moving throughout the set.

To build just run `make` and it should do the job. The prerequisites are a C
compiler, Make and SDL development libraries.
